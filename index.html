        <div class="section" id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) injury is a common sports injury, often resulting from rapid directional changes, sudden stops, or hyperextension of the knee. Recovery after ACL reconstruction surgery requires a structured rehabilitation plan to restore strength, stability, and mobility. This guide breaks down each phase of recovery with detailed exercises, professional tips, and progress milestones.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Early Mobility Section -->
        <div class="section" id="early-mobility">
            <h2>Month 1-2: Early Mobility</h2>
            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Goals:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regain range of motion in the knee</li>
                    <li>Reduce swelling and inflammation</li>
                    <li>Initiate light strengthening exercises safely</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="exercise">
                <h3>Exercises:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Straight Leg Raises:</strong> Lie flat on your back, keep the operated leg straight, and slowly lift it to about 45 degrees. Lower it back down with control. Repeat for 3 sets of 10. Ensure your pelvis stays level to avoid straining your lower back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quad Sets:</strong> Sit with your leg extended, tighten your quadriceps muscle, and hold for 5 seconds while pushing the back of your knee down against the floor or a rolled-up towel. Perform 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions. This helps activate the quad and reduces atrophy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ankle Pumps:</strong> While lying down, flex and point your toes repeatedly to improve blood circulation and prevent blood clots. Perform for 2-3 minutes several times daily.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Month 3-4: Building Strength</h2>
            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Goals:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strengthen the quadriceps, glute, and hamstring muscles</li>
                    <li>Enhance knee stability</li>

            <div class="exercise">
                <h3>Exercises:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mini Squats:</strong> Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Lower into a squat, bending your knees to 30-45 degrees, keeping your knees aligned over your feet. Hold for 2 seconds and return to standing. Do 3 sets of 10-15.</li>
                    <li><strong>Single-Leg Balance:</strong> Stand on the operated leg on an unstable surface, such as a pillow or foam pad. Attempt to balance for 15-30 seconds, gradually progressing to closing your eyes for added difficulty. Perform 3 sets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step-Ups:</strong> Use a low step (4-6 inches). Step up with the operated leg, then bring the other leg up. Step back down in reverse order. Repeat for 3 sets of 10.</li>

                    <li><strong>Lunges:</strong> Perform forward lunges, ensuring your knee stays aligned over your ankle. Begin with shallow lunges and progress to deeper movements. Perform 3 sets of 10 on each leg.</li>
                    <li><strong>Side Steps with Resistance Band:</strong> Place a resistance band around your thighs. Step sideways, maintaining tension in the band. Perform 3 sets of 20 steps in each direction.</li>
